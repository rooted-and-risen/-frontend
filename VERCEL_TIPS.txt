Vercel Deployment Tips
- Frontend: Best deployed as a static app (Vite/Next). Set REACT_APP_API_BASE env var in Vercel dashboard to the backend URL.
- Backend: Deploy to a server provider (Render, Railway, Fly, Heroku). For small projects, Render or Railway are easy to use.
- Mailchimp / ConvertKit: Use their embed forms or API; add environment variables for API keys.
- Recommended production changes:
  - Replace file-based posts.json with a managed DB (Postgres via Supabase/Render).
  - Replace demo auth with Supabase Auth / Auth0 / Clerk.
  - Store images in object storage (S3, Supabase Storage) and save URLs.
